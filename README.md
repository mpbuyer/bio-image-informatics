# Bio-Image-Informatics
This repository is meant to showcase classifying, detecting, and segmenting diseases in the thorax area based on chest x-ray data. 
## Classification
The MIMIC (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care) dataset https://physionet.org/content/mimic-cxr/2.0.0/ is for classification. Models I tested are Swin Transformer https://github.com/microsoft/Swin-Transformer/tree/main, CheXzero

## Localization
Localization involved detecting nodules given this challenge dataset: https://node21.grand-challenge.org. I tried Faster R-CNN
